The Soviet commander, Marshal Tukhachevsky, saw the defeat of Poland as a means to bring Communist revolution to Germany. But the Soviets were defeated by Polish forces under Marshal Pilsudski. The territory gained by Poland by the Treaty of Riga (1921) contained a substantial Polish population, especially in the cities of Wilno and Lwow.

When blood touches these other organs, especially inside the abdomen, it can cause inflammation and irritation, creating pain.”\nAnd, WebMd further explains: “...because the escaped tissue is growing in other tissues, the blood it makes cannot escape. This causes irritation to the surrounding tissue, which causes cysts, scars, and the fusing of body tissues. This can eventually bind the reproductive organs together and lead to infertility."\n\nIt’s so rare to see endometriosis mentioned, and I’m grateful when I do see it discussed somewhere beyond endo-related social media and blogs.

This ad was basically telling men that being masculine does not equal violence and discrimination. Growing up, boys are told not to cry, to “man up”. When boys fight to resolve solutions, it’s always “boys will be boys”. They have this engraved in their head that in order to be a man, you must not express emotions, you don’t need to care for others. The most powerful part of the ad was the part where they turned back time and showed how the better way of handling situations. Encouraging the young boys to not treat each other that way, for men to call out other men doing wrong. \n\tI believe the outrage on the ad was quite sad. People believed that this ad was anti-men, when in fact, it was empowering. It encouraged men to be the best version of themselves. It went against everything boys had to grow up with.

The controversy is needed to create a change.\n\tThis ad is amazing for young boys to see.

According to the US Department of Health and the NPAR, 63% of youth suicides, 90% of all homeless and runaway children, 60% of convicted sex offenders, and 71% of all high school dropouts come from single parent household (77% of single parents were mothers as of 2013).  These statistics show that without a father, children often turn to self-deprecation or crime.  With this in mind, rather than urging virtuous men to combat evil ones, Gillette should have pushed for a more positive, less controversial message: strong family values.

In 1871 a SIRR ferry exploded in Lower Manhattan, causing 68 deaths and the SIRR to enter receivership.  In 1883 the Baltimore and Ohio RR (B&O) acquired controlling interest in the SIRR, constructed a bridge to New Jersey in 1889, and finally purchased it outright in 1899, including the Manhattan ferries.   NYC government then bought the S.I. Ferry service in 1905, but the B&O retained the steam train service on the island, but then known as the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad (SIRT).\n\nIn the 1920’s the subway tunnel proposal motivated the SIRT to purchase electric trains with similar dimensions to the BMT subway, so that SIRT trains could be a through operation between S.I. and Manhattan via Brooklyn.  In 1925 electric trains began running between St. George and Tottenville, unchanged from today’s basic service.   Two additional, short electrified branches, to Arlington and South Beach, saw passenger service end in 1953.\n\nThe B&O sold SIRT to MTA in 1971, which in turn introduced the current R44 car fleet in 1973, replacing the 1925 rolling stock.   With the exception of the MetroCard fare system introduced in 1997, and a recent consolidation of two stations into one, the line is unchanged today.\n\n", '1548031590', 0, 'nyt://article/da6daae8-1b8a-5a71-9306-2462331d2604', 41314602), (30254095, 'Interesting how many short-sighted ideas kept Staten Island so isolated (yes, I know that some like it that way).

Second, that navy vessel of the South used a radar that is exclusively set up for the firing of anti-aircraft weapons when it was spotted by a Japanese P1 surveillance aircraft.  The Japanese contacted the South's vessel but there was no response, a clear and utmost neglect of international conventions.

I feel like the people up north are lucky as they get all the powder and here in Philadelphia, it’s hot. I don’t have anyone in my family that gets affected by snow and freezing temperatures. Freezing temperatures are my favourite type of weather. In my school I like opening the windows because it is too hot, but a certain teacher dislikes the windows open and they end up staying closed. I hate the summer and I love the winter, but my parents disagree to their full extent. There is nothing I dislike about this weather and winter. Its magical, in my opinion. It’s just fun when your week gets cut off short because of foot or to of white powder falls from the sky. One of the best things to do in the winter is sledding. Hands down. It’s great when you can sled from your yard down the stairs, through the street, then down the hill, and not get yelled at or run over! You can also throw snowballs at cars driving by which i advise to the full extent for the best winter action (not actually. Please do not try this at home, i am not liable). It’s best to spend the cold days outside, where the world is different from the way you left it before the freeze, it’s very fun to explore this new environment.

That\'s not the case for NASDAQ or BRITCOM.\n\nSecond, an abbreviation is usually printed with a period.  Many words orginate as abbreviations, but become words with increased usage.  "Brit" is an example.  "Lorry (Brit. Eng.) for truck" uses the abbreviation "Brit."  "A Brit in the office asked me where he could get a rubber, meaning eraser" uses the derived word, Brit, without the period.   See why this can get tricky?\n\nThere are many abbreviation-derived words that aren\'t abbreviations.  Acronyms (radar and NASDAQ) and initialisms (SEC and FCC) are two categories.  Both are pronounced as written (either as a word or as letters) so they\'re not abbreviations.  MPEG is in between.
